## About Prestashop Caches
### Smarty Cache
The smarty templates in themes and modules are cached in PrestaShop. These templates are stored in compiled form so that rendering is faster.
### Symfony Cache:
This cache exists only in PrestaShop version >= 1.7.x.x. Symfony offers 3 types of the cache by default:
Configuration: config, services (in YML, XML etc)
Controllers: YML, Annotations/routing
Doctrine: Entity mapping e.g. fields-columns, table
### Media Cache
This cache stores the assets cache i.e. CSS and JS files. You can enable/disable this cache in the CCC section of the Performance tab
This cache is stored in themes/your-theme/assets/cache directory
### XML Cache
The XML cache is stored in config/xml directory.
### APC Cache
APC is opcode cache for PHP scripts.
### Opcache
The Alternative PHP Cache (APC)
### Note.
APC and OPcache enable sites to serve page content significantly faster. Using APC or Opcache with PrestaShop is a great way to speed up your site.
